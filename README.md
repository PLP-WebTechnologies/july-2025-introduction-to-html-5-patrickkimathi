# HTML5 + Accessibility & SEO Basics

This project demonstrates how to build a simple, semantically structured web page using HTML5, with a focus on accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) best practices.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Uses elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for clear, meaningful layout.
- **Accessibility:** 
  - Navigation uses `aria-label` for assistive technologies.
  - All images should use descriptive `alt` attributes (add as needed).
  - Content is organized for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **SEO Best Practices:**
  - Includes descriptive `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="keywords">`, and `<meta name="author">`.
  - Uses clear, hierarchical headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
  - Content is human-readable and includes relevant keywords.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the sample page.
3. Review the code to see examples of semantic HTML, accessibility features, and SEO-friendly markup.

## Structure

- **Header:** Contains the main title and navigation menu.
- **Main:** Includes an About section, Accessibility tips, and SEO basics.
- **Footer:** Provides contact information and copyright.
